# Line-Following-Robot
This project develops an automated guided vehicle (AGV) or line-following robot using two IR sensors, an ESP32, an L298N motor driver, and DC motors. The IR sensors detect the path, and the ESP32 processes inputs to control the motors, ensuring precise navigation. Ideal for autonomous transport and delivery applications.
